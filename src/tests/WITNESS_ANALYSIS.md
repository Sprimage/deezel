# Witness Stack Analysis - Critical Findings

## Problem Identified

The deezel transaction has the **alkanes payload in the wrong witness position**.

## Working Transaction Structure (Correct)

**Input 0 Witness Stack:**
1. **Element 0**: 64 bytes - **Schnorr Signature** ✅
2. **Element 1**: 78,394 bytes - **Alkanes Payload** ✅  
3. **Element 2**: 33 bytes - **Control Block** ✅

## Deezel Transaction Structure (Incorrect)

**Input 0 Witness Stack:**
1. **Element 0**: 118,535 bytes - **Alkanes Payload** ❌ WRONG!
2. **Element 1**: 33 bytes - **Control Block** ❌ WRONG!

**Input 1 Witness Stack:**
1. **Element 0**: 64 bytes - **Schnorr Signature** ✅

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Should Be in the First Witness Element

For P2TR script path spending, the **first witness element must be the signature**, not the payload.

The correct P2TR script path witness stack order is:
1. **Signature** (64 bytes for Schnorr)
2. **Script/Payload** (the alkanes envelope data)
3. **Control Block** (33+ bytes, contains internal key + merkle proof)

### Current Deezel Issue

Deezel is placing the alkanes payload as the **first element** instead of the **second element**. This violates the P2TR spending rules and likely causes the transaction to be invalid.

## Fix Required

The deezel transaction construction needs to be modified to:

1. **Put the signature FIRST** in the witness stack
2. **Put the alkanes payload SECOND** in the witness stack  
3. **Put the control block THIRD** in the witness stack

## Additional Observations

- The deezel payload (118,535 bytes) is significantly larger than the working payload (78,394 bytes)
- Both payloads have high entropy (7.99) indicating compression/encryption
- Both contain the alkanes envelope structure starting with `00630342494e` (envelope header)
- The working transaction uses a single input while deezel uses two inputs

## Payload Analysis

Both transactions contain alkanes envelope data:

```

**Deezel payload preview:**
```

```

Both start with alkanes envelope headers but have different structures, suggesting different envelope construction approaches.

## Immediate Action Required

**Fix the witness stack order in deezel's transaction construction:**
- Move signature to position 0
- Move alkanes payload to position 1  
- Move control block to position 2

This should resolve the transaction validation issues.
