   - Potential API changes or downtime
   - Consistency of external data sources
   - Handling network latency and timeouts

3. **Operational Challenges**
   - Long-term resource usage optimization
   - Handling increasing UTXO sets
   - Maintaining performance over time
   - Ensuring data integrity during failures
