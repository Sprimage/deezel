# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in its implementation phase. The basic module structure has been established, and we have implemented the core functionality for DIESEL token minting and management.

### Active Development Areas

1. **Core Infrastructure Setup** âœ…
   - Project structure and organization
   - Dependency configuration
   - Build system setup
   - Command-line argument parsing for RPC URLs
   - Library and binary structure

2. **Wallet Implementation** ðŸ”„
   - BDK integration for Bitcoin wallet functionality âœ…
   - Custom Esplora backend for Sandshrew RPC âœ…
   - UTXO management with ordinal and rune constraints ðŸ”„
   - Wallet state persistence ðŸ”„

3. **Block Monitoring** ðŸ”„
   - Bitcoin RPC integration for `getblockcount`
   - Metashrew RPC integration for `metashrew_height`
   - Block height verification (Metashrew height = Bitcoin height + 1)
   - Rate limiting implementation

4. **Transaction Construction** ðŸ”„
   - Runestone with Protostone creation
   - Protocol-specific message encoding
   - Output consolidation logic
   - UTXO selection using `spendablesbyaddress` via protobuf

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Under Consideration

1. **Concurrency Model**
   - Evaluating between thread-based and async approaches
   - Considering Tokio for async runtime
   - Assessing performance implications for long-running processes

2. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Determining appropriate error propagation
   - Considering retry policies for transient failures
   - Evaluating logging and monitoring requirements

3. **Persistence Strategy**
   - Evaluating file-based vs. database storage for wallet state
   - Considering encryption requirements for sensitive data
   - Assessing backup and recovery mechanisms

4. **Fee Estimation Approach**
   - Determining optimal fee estimation strategy
   - Considering dynamic fee adjustment based on confirmation time
   - Evaluating balance between cost efficiency and confirmation speed

### Open Questions

1. **Scaling Considerations**
   - How will the application handle increasing UTXO sets?
   - What are the performance implications of monitoring multiple wallets?
   - How can we optimize for long-term operation?

2. **Security Concerns**
   - What are the security implications of persistent key storage?
   - How should we handle potential chain reorganizations?
   - What measures are needed to protect against potential attacks?

3. **Operational Considerations**
   - What monitoring and alerting are required for production use?
   - How should the application handle network outages?
   - What recovery procedures are needed for various failure scenarios?

## Current Priorities

1. Implement core wallet functionality with BDK
2. Develop block monitoring with Sandshrew RPC
3. Create transaction construction with Runestone/Protostone
4. Integrate components for end-to-end operation
5. Implement comprehensive testing
